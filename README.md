## Skew T Analysing Script

This project aims to fetch the vertical air profile from the NOAA and analyse the data to get an idea of the cloud types currently in the sky.

We are getting our vertical temperature data from Iowa State University's Mesonet.
We use Papa Parse to parse to CSV we get from https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu.
